## 1. Updating attendance for other entities

**b. Edit Attendance:** As a class teacher, I can edit the marked attendance in the past so that I can maintain an updated record of my students’ attendance.
View Emoticons: As a teacher, I can view emoticons against each student based on their past attendance patterns so that I can have one look and know the performance of each child in terms of attendance.

**c. Summary Reports:** As a teacher, I can view, share, download and  compare my one-pager summary reports so that I can make quick decisions regarding improvement of students' attendance in my class.
