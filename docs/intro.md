# Introduction

Shiksha helps you create highly configurable, end-user experiences in education using NDEAR building blocks. 

Edtech in India has expanded exponentially since the onset of Covid in a fragmented offline universe of public schools. Public schools form the backbone of education in India and as the world came online there have been no trustworthy ways for the public school education system to leverage the power of this edtech growth. Shiksha's mission is to empower the public education systems with  edtech products that have delightful and dependable end user experiences, are interoperable with NDEAR building blocks and easy to build on.

Since Shiksha leverages NDEAR building blocks, this repository will contain the Shiksha API that the frontend uses, adapters to connect to different NDEAR building blocks e.g. registries, telemetry, etc.
